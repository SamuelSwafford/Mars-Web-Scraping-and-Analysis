# Mars Web Scraping and Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that focus on web scraping and data analysis of Mars weather data. The project is divided into two main deliverables:

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
- This notebook (`part_1_mars_news.ipynb`) uses Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape the latest news titles and preview texts from the Mars news site.

## Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
- The second notebook (`part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`) focuses on scraping Mars weather data from a table using Beautiful Soup and analyzing the data with Pandas. The analysis includes identifying Martian months, calculating the average minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure, and estimating the length of a Martian year in terrestrial days.
